# Taskboard

**Rovi's Taskboard** is a full stack website for giving me tasks to do. These tasks can be ideas for games, songs, or any projects I'm working on; features for anything that's already up and running, or issues that need to be fixed.

...well, that's what it's supposed to look like.

It's a fun proof of concept, so I won't actually be using it as a type of kanban board, or anything like that. Though, feel free to use it, just to populate it with stuff.

The website can be viewed over at [rovidecena.com/taskboard/](https://www.rovidecena.com/taskboard/)
